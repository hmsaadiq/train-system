For this project we have written a program that will assign train seats to passengers using c++.
What we have done is we made the program using functions,
The first function “printSeats” which shows the output of the ticket booking system, telling the user what to do and also outputs the rows and columns showing the available options.
The next function “cost” is the one that holds the prices of the seats, when the user selects a row and seat this function tells the price of that particular seat depending on the class which the seat is located.
The function “sumSeats” calculates the total cost of all the seats that have been booked.
Then finally the “int main” this output the prices of the seats and gives the user the option of choosing the seats available then it outputs the total cost of everything that has been booked. Arter that it asks the user whether he wants to book anther seat of if he’s done, then it closes the code
